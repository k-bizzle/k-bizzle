- 👋 Hi, I’m @k-bizzle
- 👀 I’m interested in changing my career up or at least impressing my coworkers and boss...
- 🌱 I’ve completed some basic web development courses and am now in a full stack bootcamp. I wish I would've found this love for coding earlier in life so I could be creating new Google by now!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything and everything.
- 📫 How to reach me - with both arms
